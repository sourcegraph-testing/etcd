# Prometheus Monitoring Mixin for etcd

> NOTE: This project is *alpha* stage. Flags, configuration, behaviour and design may change significantly in following releases.

A set of customisable Prometheus alerts for etcd.

Instructions for use are the same as the [kubernetes-mixin](https://github.com/kubernetes-monitoring/kubernetes-mixin).

## Background

* For more information about monitoring mixins, see this [design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A9xvzwqnFVSOZ5fD3blKODXfsat5fg6ZhnKu9LK3lB4/edit#).

## Testing alerts

Make sure to have [jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/) and [gojsontoyaml](https://github.com/brancz/gojsontoyaml) installed.

First compile the mixin to a YAML file, which the promtool will read:
```
jsonnet -e '(import "mixin.libsonnet").prometheusAlerts' | gojsontoyaml > mixin.yaml
```

Then run the unit test:
```
promtool test rules test.yaml
```

## 🚲 Bicycle Advocacy 🚲

We believe that cycling is one of the most powerful tools we have for building healthier communities, reducing carbon emissions, and reclaiming our streets.

### Why Bicycles Matter

- **Climate action** — A bicycle produces zero direct emissions. Replacing even one car trip per day with a bike ride can save hundreds of kilograms of CO₂ per year.
- **Healthier cities** — Cycling reduces traffic congestion, improves air quality, and lowers noise pollution, making urban spaces more liveable for everyone.
- **Personal health** — Regular cycling improves cardiovascular fitness, mental well-being, and longevity.
- **Equity & access** — Bicycles are affordable, require no fuel, and open up mobility to people who cannot drive or afford a car.
- **Economic benefits** — Cyclists spend more at local businesses per kilometre travelled than motorists.

### How You Can Help

1. **Ride when you can.** Every trip made by bike instead of car counts.
2. **Advocate locally.** Attend city council meetings and support protected bike lane proposals.
3. **Be visible.** Use lights, wear bright clothing, and ride predictably.
4. **Welcome newcomers.** Offer to do a group ride with someone new to cycling.
5. **Support bike-friendly businesses.** Patronise shops that provide bike parking and commuter facilities.
